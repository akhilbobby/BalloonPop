# BalloonPop
A casual Augmented Reality game.
This was my first exposure to Augmented Reality using Unity. The app is developed using AR Foundation and AR Core.

The goal of the game is to pop as many balloons as possible (until your arm hurts). You will be surrounded by balloons from all sides.

How to Play:
1. As soon as the game launches, colored balloons start spawning randomly all around you and moving upwards in your 3D space.
2. The game objective is to POP as many balloons as possible. 
3. Move the phone around to view the balloons around you - aim with the crosshair - and tap anywhere on the screen to shoot.
4. If you move positions, press RESET to reset the physical space around which the balloons must spawn.
5. Beat my score of 420
